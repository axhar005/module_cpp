## Overview

Welcome to "module_cpp," a personal project dedicated to mastering the C++ programming language as part of my 42 curriculum. This repository serves as my coding playground and knowledge hub for all things C++.

## Project Goals

My primary goals in this project are as follows:

- Gain a solid understanding of C++ fundamentals, including syntax and data types.
- Explore advanced C++ concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Master memory management, dynamic allocation, and smart pointers.
- Utilize the power of standard C++ libraries.
- Develop practical and fun projects to apply my newfound knowledge.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into distinct modules, each dedicated to a specific aspect of C++. You can find detailed documentation, code samples, and exercises within these modules. Feel free to explore and learn alongside me.

## Version Control

I maintain this project using Git, making it easy to track progress and changes. You can explore different branches, commits, and milestones to follow my journey in mastering C++.

## Contributions

Although this project primarily serves my learning journey, I welcome contributions, suggestions, and feedback from the community. If you have ideas, corrections, or improvements to share, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.
